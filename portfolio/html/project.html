        <p><strong>Detail:</strong> People in our community often have extra usable items while others urgently search for lost belongings,
             but social media posts are unorganized, unsafe, and lack proper tracking. ShareBox solves this by offering
             a centralized platform with smart matching, secure in-app chat, and scheduled handovers for safe and transparent exchanges.
             For development, I chose the Agile Iterative (Scrum-based) model, where the system is built in short sprints with continuous
             planning, feedback, and improvement until completion.<br/> <br/>

        <p><strong>Detail:</strong> The “Animated City Road Scenario” is an interactive OpenGL (C++) project that
            simulates a lively city environment with a two-lane road, moving vehicles, zebra crossing, buildings,
             trees, field, lake, and animated sky elements like the sun, clouds, birds, and airplane. Users can
             interact through a button-controlled pedestrian crossing and toggle between day and night modes with
              dynamic lighting changes. The project demonstrates graphics programming concepts including animation,
               object rendering, transformations, and real-time input handling.

        <p><strong>Detail:</strong> The Cafe Shop Management System is a C#-based application designed to
            efficiently manage daily operations of a café, including order processing, billing, menu management,
            and customer records. The system allows staff to take orders, generate invoices, manage inventory,
            and track sales reports through a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrates concepts of database
            integration (SQL), CRUD operations, form design, and real-time data handling in C# for building a practical
            business management solution.
