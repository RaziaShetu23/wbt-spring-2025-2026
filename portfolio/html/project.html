    <h1>Project Name: SmartRent: Urban Housing Price Estimator</h1>

    <h2>The Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This project uses Linear Regression (or similar algorithms) to predict 
        the price of homes. Instead of guessing, the model learns from thousands 
        of past home sales. It figures out how much things like a balcony, an 
        extra bathroom, or being near a subway station affect the price.
    </p>

    <h2>The "Features" (Your Data Columns)</h2>
    <p>To make this work, you need a dataset (for example, from Zillow or Kaggle) that includes:</p>

    <h3>Physical Traits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Square footage</li>
        <li>Number of bedrooms</li>
        <li>Number of bathrooms</li>
        <li>Floor level</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Zip code</li>
        <li>Distance to the city center</li>
        <li>Walk Score</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>External Factors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Local property tax rates</li>
        <li>Year built (age of the building)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Workflow</h2>

    <h3>1. Data Scrubbing</h3>
    <p>
        Remove unusual or incorrect data (for example, a small apartment 
        listed at $10 million by mistake).
    </p>

    <h3>2. Correlation Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Find out which features affect price the most. 
        (Usually square footage and location are most important.)
    </p>

    <h3>3. Model Training</h3>
    <p>
        Teach the computer how to calculate price per square foot 
        in different neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Error Testing</h3>
    <p>
        Calculate the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure 
        how far off the predictions usually are.
    </p>
